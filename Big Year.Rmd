The objective of this code is to create the ultimate big year list where every bird species that lives in the USA is accounted for between Jan 1 - Dec 31. 
We will do this by:
+ generating a reference list of species in the USA that are not vagrants or subspecies
+ accessing eBird's 2019 data using APIs
+ selecting one checklist per day that will get us the closest to our target species count
+ writing an algorithm that prioritizes highly endemic and other rare/cryptic species 

The algorithm will then sequentially fill in missing species inversely related to their frequency. Let's see how quickly we can achieve *the* Big Year!
